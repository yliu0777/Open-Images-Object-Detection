    "# Introduction\n",
    "##### Google research launched the competion Open Images 2019 Object Detection on Kaggle on 06/03/2019 following its previous pair of competitions hosted in 2018. This competition built an ideal platform for people interested in ML/DL/CV to get some good insights into the latest technologies used in relative academic/industrial fields and offered a great opportunity to play with real-world large-scale image dataset. <br>This public notebook & repository is to collect and summarize relative online public notes/code implementations/research papers as well as my personal ipython notebook and results for the purpose of recording, sharing as well as self-monitoring. Any questions, suggestions or supplementations are welcomed!\n",
